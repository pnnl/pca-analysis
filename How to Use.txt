<<< Download Instructions >>>
First, download the latest Ubuntu version in addition to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on your personal
or PNNL computer. Then open Ubuntu and download your preferred version of python3 via pip or Anaconda. (For Mac 
users, just download Python.)

Once Python is installed, you will need to get the packages numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and docx
appropriate for your OS / distribution. If you are on the PNNL network, you NEED to use the proxy option when 
installing these packages via pip or you will get a bunch of error messages. The command 
pip install --proxy=http://proxy01.pnl.gov:3128 <package name> should do the trick.
